# SpeedCooking: Data Visualisation for cooking recipes

## Project

[in progress]

This project aims to represent an alternative way to understand recepis when cooking. The classic succession of steps, despite its indisputable simplicity, may not be the ultimate tool to master complex recipes processes.

Our [project](https://tblondelle.github.io/DataVisualisationProject/) solves this problem with a clear visualisation of the required tasks. It thus allows a quick parallelisation of the work.

## Context 


## Problem
Recepies are often represented as a sucessions of several steps in a cooking book. In the case of complex recepies, this representation doesn't show which steps can be performed simultaneously. We are looking for an alternative way to represent recepies that shows clearly simultaneous tasks in order to simplify organisation.
