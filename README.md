# SpeedCooking: Data Visualisation for cooking recipes

## Project

[in progress]

This project aims to represent an alternative way to understand recepis when cooking. The classic succession of steps, despite its indisputable simplicity, may not be the ultimate tool to master complex recipes processes.

Our [project](https://tblondelle.github.io/DataVisualisationProject/) solves this problem with a clear visualisation of the required tasks. It thus allows a quick parallelisation of the work.

## Context 


## Problem
Recepies are often represented as a sucessions of several steps in a cooking book. In the case of complex recepies, this representation doesn't show which steps can be performed simultaneously. We are looking for an alternative way to represent recepies that shows clearly simultaneous tasks in order to simplify organisation. 

## State of the art

We can find recepies in cooking books or on specialised websites. The way recepies are represented on websites or in cooking books is similar : 

* List of ingredients
* List of tools
* Number of portions
* Other informations
* List of different steps to perform

<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/img/recette_brookie_marmiton.JPG" style="width: 200px;">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" bgcolor="EFEFEF">
     Screenshot of the website www.marmiton.org .
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The possibilities given by interactivity of the internet are not used in the visualisation : a recepie from a website can be printed without making any difference. 


## Solution

The idea we had is to visualise recepies like a tree. Several branches merge in
